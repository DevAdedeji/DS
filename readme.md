#----------
# Big O
Its a standard mathematical notation that is used to measure how efficient an algorithm is.

# **Big O Rule Book**
1. Worst Case - We must take care of worst case of an algorithm
2. Remove Constants
3. Different terms for inputs
    + for steps in 
    * for nested steps
4. Drop non dominant terms

# Algorithm efficiency
This is referred to as the amount of computational resources used by the algorithm

## Time Complexity
Time complexity is how much time an algorithms takes to run...


## Space Complexity
Space complexity is how much memory an algorithm takes to run...
--What causes space complexity-- 
1. Variables
2. Data Structures
3. Function Call
4. Allocations

# Scalabiltiy of an algorithm
It refers to how much an algorithm slows down as the amount of input increases.
